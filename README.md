# myCOVIDNumber
My first of two capstones as part of [Springboard's](https://www.springboard.com/) 700+ hr Software Engineering bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to create a website people could visit to keep track of the COVID-19 numbers in their homestate, the states, of their lived ones, and somewhere that provided relative resources.
